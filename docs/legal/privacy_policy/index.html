We may share your information with third party service providers who use this information to perform services for us, such as payment processors, hosting providers, auditors, advisors, contractors and consultants. In addition, The Linux Foundation performs services for LFP as a managed services provider with regards to Projects. In such cases, LFP may share with The Linux Foundation the same types of data as described above, doing so in the furtherance of performing services for those Projects. The Linux Foundation’s privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/">https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/</a>.</li>
<li><em>Affiliates</em>. The information collected about you may be accessed by or shared with related companies and affiliates of LFP, whose use and disclosure of your personal information is subject to this Privacy Policy, unless an affiliate has its own separate privacy policy.</li>

<li><em>Anonymized and Aggregated Data</em>. We may share aggregate or de-identified information with third parties for research, marketing, analytics and other purposes, provided such information does not identify a particular individual.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="project-specific-uses">Project-specific Uses</h4>

Any personal data relating to such requests is subject to Mapbox’s privacy policy.

</ul>
<h4 id="cookies-tracking-and-interest-based-ads">Cookies, Tracking, and Interest-Based Ads</h4>
<p>We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your usage and browsing activities on our Site and across third party sites or online services. We may combine this information with other information we collect about Users. Below, we provide a brief summary these activities. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cookies</em>. These are small files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use the Sites, and to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third party sites and applications).</li>
<li>Pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs_. These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which we track browsing activities. We use these as part of our Training Affiliate Program. We also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.</li>
<li>Analytics Tools_. We may use internal and third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics. The third-party analytics companies we work with may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online products and services. Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that LFP does not respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms intended to allow California residents to opt-out of Internet tracking under California Online Privacy Protection Action (“CalOPPA”).</p>
<p><em>Targeted Ads</em>. As discussed in our Cookie Policy, we may work with third party advertisers to display more relevant ads on our website and on third party sites; these third parties may display ads to you based on your visit to our Sites and other third party sites. For more information about this and how you can opt out of such ads, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h4 id="data-security">Data Security</h4>
<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing robust passwords that nobody else knows or can easily guess, not using a password for more than one site or service, and keeping your log-ins and passwords private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. You must promptly notify us if you become aware that any information provided by or submitted to our Sites or through our Services is lost, stolen, or used without permission at <a href="mailto:privacy@lfprojects.org">privacy@lfprojects.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="marketing-choices">Marketing Choices</h4>
<p>You may opt out or revoke your consent to receive marketing emails from us by using unsubscribe or opt out mechanisms included in our marketing emails or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@lfprojects.org">privacy@lfprojects.org</a>. You may unsubscribe from mailing lists via the applicable mailing list’s subscription website or, in some cases, by using the unsubscribe mechanisms included in such emails.</p>
<h4 id="retention-of-your-personal-data">Retention of Your Personal Data</h4>
<p>We apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required. In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.</p>
<h4 id="international-transfers">International Transfers</h4>
<p>If you are located within the European Union (EU), you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States where LFP is located. The U.S. is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection.  However, we have put in place European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses which protect personal data transferred between LFP and affiliated entities as well as The Linux Foundation, its managed service provider. In addition, if personal data is transferred to third party service providers located outside the European Union, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements, or using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU by contacting <a href="mailto:gdpr@lfprojects.org">gdpr@lfprojects.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="childrens-privacy">Children’s Privacy</h4>
<p>Except as specifically indicated within a Site, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 14 for anyone living in Spain or South Korea), or knowingly allow such persons to register. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without parental consent, we take steps to delete that information.</p>
<h4 id="links-to-third-party-sites-and-services">Links to Third Party Sites and Services</h4>
<p>The Sites may contain links to third party sites or online services. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties, whose information practices are subject to their own policies and procedures, not to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h4>
<p><em>Access and Amendment</em>. You may contact our privacy coordinator, as set forth below, to access or amend your personal information.</p>
<p><em>Additional Rights</em>. Individuals in the European Economic Area (and other jurisdictions where applicable) have additional rights under applicable law:</p>
<ul>
<li>to obtain a copy of your personal data together with information about how and on what basis that personal data is processed;</li>
<li>to rectify inaccurate personal data (including to have incomplete personal data completed);</li>
<li>to erase your personal data (in limited circumstances, such as where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);</li>
<li>to restrict processing of your personal data under certain circumstances;</li>
<li>to export certain personal data in machine-readable format to a third party (or to you) when we justify our processing on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract with you;</li>
<li>to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where that processing is based on your consent);</li>
<li>to obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization; and</li>
<li>to object to our use and processing of your personal information that is conducted on the basis of a legitimate interest or to perform a contract with you. You also have the right to object at any time to any processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, including profiling for marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lodging a Complaint</em>. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority for data protection, or privacy regulator.</p>
<p><em>Submitting a Request</em>. To exercise the above rights or contact us with questions or complaints regarding our treatment of your personal data, contact us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@lfprojects.org">gdpr@lfprojects.org</a>. Please note that we may request proof of identity, and we reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, especially if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
